<p>My name is Shaifali Agrawal, currently working with <a href="http://anitaborg.org/get-involved/systers/" target="_blank">Systers</a> as <a href="http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/homepage/google/gsoc2015" target="_blank">Google Summer of Code 2015</a> Intern.</p>

<p>I am a student, pursuing Masters in Computer Applications from <a href="http://iips.edu.in/" target="_blank">International Institute of Professional Studies</a>, <a href="http://www.dauniv.ac.in/" target="_blank">Devi Ahilya University</a> Indore, India(expecting to complete in 2016).
</p>

<p>I love Programming, Python, Data, Databases, Web Development, Git Internals, Cloud and this love led me to do my first intership with <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack Foundation</a> as <a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/" target="_blank">Outreachy</a>(previously known as Outreach Program for Women) Intern for round 9(Dec 14 to March 15). After the internship I am still contributing to OpenStack(mostly for <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Zaqar#Overview" target="_blank">Zaqar</a>).</p>

<p>I keep on participating in hackathons to foster my learning and knowledge of Computer Science. <a href="http://help-the-needy.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank">Help The Needy!</a> is one of the app that came out of a hackathon.</p>

<p>Other than Technology and Computer Science I love Dance, Arts and Craft. I spend my spare time mostly in any of these activities.</p>
