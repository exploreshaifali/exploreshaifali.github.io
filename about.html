</p>

<p>I love Programming, Python, Data, Databases, Web Development, Git Internals, Cloud and this love let me to do my first intership with <a href="https://www.openstack.org/" target="_blank">OpenStack Foundation</a> as <a href="https://www.gnome.org/outreachy/" target="_blank">Outreachy</a>(previously known as Outreach Program for Women) Intern for round 9(Dec 14 to March 15). After the internship I am still contributing to OpenStack(mostly for <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Zaqar#Overview" target="_blank">Zaqar</a>).</p>
